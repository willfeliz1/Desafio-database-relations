* [TypeORM] - an ORM that can run in Nodej, browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript
* [Yarn] - package manager that doubles down as project manager.
* [Tsyringe] - A lightweight dependency injection container for TypeScript/JavaScript for constructor injection.
* [DotEnv] - A module that loads environment variables from a .env file. 

## ðŸ’» Installation

### Docker

With docker hub installed, follow the commands:

```sh

$ docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -p 5432:5432 -d postgrees
